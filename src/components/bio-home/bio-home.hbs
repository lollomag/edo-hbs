<div class="bio-home">
  <p class="bio-text">My name is <strong>Edoardo Marcuzzi</strong> and I'm a young director, freelance journalist and creative producer born on the 19 of April in 1996, in La Spezia, a little city in Italy.<br><br>In 2015 I moved to Milan to start my university career in <strong>Media Languages of Cinema</strong> and I graduated in 2019. During this period of my life, I collaborated for 3 years and half for a cultural association of my university, where every month I had to publish various articles about the cinema world and we were often invited to report some festivals, about cinema and music, around Italy.<br><br>I also had different work experiences, first with a production based in Milan, where I worked as an editor and assistant director, and after for a radio planning the interviews. I also assisted one professor of my university to publish a book about the literature of south Italy.
  In 2020 I moved to <strong>Barcelona</strong> starting a master's degree in filmmaking. With my class I directed 5 shortmovies and I collaborated with many others doing different jobs.<br><br>In my initial career as a director, I focused my attention in the horror genre, trying to show stories with a scary storytelling. But I want to increase my knowledge of the differents kinds of cinema and video productions and I consider myself a flexible videomaker, because I also made some videos about sports events or crowdfunding's campaigns.
